🚍 Sustainable Cities: Public Transport Route Optimization
🌍 Project Overview

This project supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities by using Artificial Intelligence to improve urban public transport efficiency.
It applies Machine Learning (ML) clustering to group nearby bus stops and optimize potential transport routes for better accessibility, reduced congestion, and sustainable urban mobility.

🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how data-driven approaches can help city planners:

Identify high-demand areas for bus services.

Optimize routes to minimize passenger waiting times.

Support eco-friendly and efficient public transportation systems.
